        <h1>About: </h1>
        <p style="font-size: 18px">Hello there! You've stumbled across my soon to be notebook filled with a bunch of junk really. I plan to use this site as a platform to record and reflect on my inquiry-based observations, investigations, and experiments in relation to all things science and engineering. This will be my home base for documenting all things that I am personally interested in while trying to grasp better concepts of said interest by sharing my own perspective. I think I will find this to be a great medium to cummunicate my understanding of things I'm learning and/or want to learn. I believe it will also allow me to remain curious about the world and be motivated to document that curiousity. Feel free to check out some of my existing projects on <a href="https://github.com/landonbr" target="blank">Github</a> some of which I may document in more detail here soon. And connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/landonbr/" target="blank">Linkedin</a>! For now, enjoy this lovely photo of my dog :^) </p>
